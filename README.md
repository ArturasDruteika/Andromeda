# Andromeda
An engine made to display solar system.

### Set Up
1. Download [3rdParty](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=12FWyoT9oNLicftqyYy6T3bgmBVZnht8h) and place the extracted catalog next to andromeda src code like this:
    ```
        path/to/catalog/
            ├── andromeda
            ├── 3rdParty
    ```
2. Build andromeda project

### Future goals
1. Develop a 3D engine utilizing OpenGL that can render the [solar system application](https://github.com/ArturasDruteika/SolarSystem).
2. Implement ray tracing.
3. (In the far far future) develop the same engine using Vulkan.

### Notes
At the moment I do not intend it to be an engine dedicated to creating games or anything like that. It is just a simple learning project.
